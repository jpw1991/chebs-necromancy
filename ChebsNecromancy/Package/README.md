# Cheb's Necromancy

Cheb's Necromancy adds Necromancy to Valheim via craftable wands and structures. Minions will follow you, guard your base, and perform menial tasks like woodcutting, farming, mining.

This mod was formerly called Friendly Skeleton Wand, but was renamed since it as grown into something so much more.

## Requirements

- Valheim
- BepInEx
- Jotunn

## Installation (manual)

- Drag the contents of the `plugins` folder from inside the archive to your BepInEx plugins folder in the Valheim directory.

## Features

Detailed info in the [wiki](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki). Here's the short version:

- Almost everything is configurable. Minions too weak/overpowered? Tweak them.
- [Player vs Player (PvP)](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/PvP) settings can be configured as of 4.5.0.
- Craftable items at the workbench and forge:
	+ [**Skeleton Wand**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/item_skeletonwand): Summons skeleton warriors, archers, miners, and woodcutters.
	+ [**Draugr Wand**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/item_draugrwand): Summons draugr warriors and archers.
	+ [**Orb of Beckoning**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/OrbOfBeckoning) Summons skeleton mages and can be thrown to direct minions to go somewhere. It also sticks to enemies so that minions will chase after an enemy.
	+ [**Spectral Shroud**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/item_spectralshroud): A cloak that increases your Necromancy level, looks cool, and attracts spirits to it. If you're powerful enough, they will serve.
	+ [**Necromancer Hood**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/item_necromancerhood): A cool hood to match the cloak.
	+ [**Necromancer's Backpack**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/NecromancyBackpack): An optional integration with **AdventureBackpacks** ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2204), [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Vapok/AdventureBackpacks/)), which offers a Necromancy backpack that doubles as a Spectral Shroud.
- While holding a Skeleton Wand, Draugr Wand, or Orb of Beckoning you can control the minions:
	+ **B** will make a minion.
	+ **H** will cycle minion types (eg. switch from Warrior to Archer) created by **B**.
	+ **F** will make all nearby minions **follow** you.
	+ **T** will make all nearby minions **wait**.
	+ **Shift+T** will make minions **roam**.
	+ **G** will teleport all following minions to your position (useful if stuck or to get them on boats)
- A new **Necromancy Skill** which increases the quality of your minions and allows you to upgrade them.
- Minion health increases with Necromancy level.
- Minions **ignore collision** with the player so you won't be trapped.
- Minions do not deal damage to player structures and are not affected by sharpened stakes.
- Minions remember who created them and cannot be commanded by other players.
- **Upgrades:** Having additional items in your inventory when you summon can create an upgraded version of a minion. As a safety measure to prevent you from accidentally consuming stuff, hold Left Shift when creating a minion to permit these resources to be consumed (or set to None in the config if you want no checking whatsoever):
  - Boar scraps, Deer Hide, Scale Hide -> leather armor
  - Troll Hide -> Troll armor
  - Wolf Pelt -> Wolf armor
  - Lox Pelt -> Lox armor
  - Bronze -> Bronze armor
  - Iron -> Iron armor
  - Black Metal -> Black Iron armor
- Some minions require more than bones:
  - Guck -> poison skeleton
  - Surtling core -> skeleton mage
  - Flint -> skeleton lumberjack
  - Hard Antler -> Skeleton Miner
- New craftable structures:
	+ [**Neckro Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/piece_neckropylon): Spawns undead Neckro Gatherers from Neck Tails. These have a container on its back and wander around gathering up items for you. It's like a walking vacuum cleaner. When full, the Neckro will find a nearby container and dump the items inside.
	+ [**Refueler Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/piece_refueler): Fills your smelters with ores/coal; kilns with wood; fireplaces with wood and meat; and torches etc. with resin, guck, eyeballs, whatever.
	+ [**Bat Beacon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/piece_batbeacon): Spawns bats to defend your base.
	+ [**Spirit Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/piece_spiritpylon): Spawns spirits to defend your base.
	+ [**Farming Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/FarmingPylon): Automatically harvests your crops. Combine with **Seed Totem** ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/876), [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/MathiasDecrock/SeedTotem/)) to then automatically replant those seeds for an automated base.
	+ [**Repair Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/RepairPylon): Consumes resin to repair your structures.
	+ [**Treasure Pylon**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/TreasurePylon): Organizes your chests in a rather chaotic way. By default only works on the basic wooden boxes but can be told to sort other things too via config. The idea is that Neckros haul all this stuff back, then the Treasure Pylon organizes it.
	+ [**Phylactery**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/Phylactery): The player who creates the phylactery will be saved from death by being teleported to the phylactery rather than killed. Each rescue costs one dragon egg and if there are no dragon eggs loaded into the phylactery, then the player will die normally.

### Config

**Attention:** To edit the config as described, the [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) is the most user friendly way. This is a separate mod. Please download and install it.

Press **F1** to open the mod's configuration panel.

You can also edit the configs manually. Almost everything can be tweaked to your liking. For a complete list of all configuration options, please look [here](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki/Configs).

## Known issues

- Players with Radeon cards may experience weird issues. I don't know what's causing it, but it's linked to the particle effects. You can switch them off by turning `RadeonFriendly = true` in the config.

## Known Incompatibilities

- Soft incompatibility with [slope combat fix](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/180) because it can mess up worker minion aiming. Not a big deal - especially if you never use miners/woodcutters. As an alternative, you may consider [Slope Combat Assistance](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Digitalroot/Digitalroots_Slope_Combat_Assistance/) because it only affects the player.
- Soft incompatibility with [Ward is Love](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/177) because it will identify workers as enemies and yeet them. As an alternative, you may consider using [Better Wards](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/BetterWards/).
- Soft incompatibility with [Item Drawers Mod](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/147) because the Neckro Gatherers try to pick the items out of the drawers.

16/12/2022 | 1.0.17 | Nice models for the wands; skeleton equipment and damage scales to necromancy level; nice texture for Spectral Shroud; add config option to disable Guardian Wraith (permits purely cosmetic Spectral Shroud); made draugr optionally cost meat as well as bone fragments to create

01/12/2022 | 1.0.8 | Big Overhaul → Fully custom prefabs used for minions results in finer control: no more Blood Magic experience; removes randomness of the skeletons so you can choose warrior/archer; permits me to add draugr and wraiths that are not hostile when you log back in; permits me to (in the future) give custom equipment and textures/materials to the minions.
